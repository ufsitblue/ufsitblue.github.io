# CyberForce Webinar: Competition 101

* As we know, this competition is focused on energy-based infrastructures and networks.

* Types of teams in this competition
    - Blue team (us)
    - Red team (attackers that will try to pwn us on Nov 4th and 5th; industry professionals)
    - White team (administrators, build out infrastructure for us)
    - Gren team (users of our systems; these people test out usability, availability of our network in real time)
    - Orange team (C-suite / senior executives)

* Generally speaking, as the blue team, we communicate with all teams throughout the competition.
    - But mostly, we aim to communicate with the green team (our network users) and the orange team (our execs)

* This year, our competition scenario involves __the solar energy__ industry.
    - In 2021, it was hydropower. 2020 was wind, 2018 was natural gas...


## SCORING BREAKDOWN

**Five main scoring categories**:

### 1: Red team
* Exploitability of vulnerabilities (they ask you about a vulnerability you found, how you found it, and what you would do to fix it -- be prepared to answer questions)

* Vulnerabilities introduced in buildouts (during live attack)

* Sportsmanship

### 2: Blue team
* Service uptime (e.g. DNS, SMTP...) -- these services are required to be on certain IPs

### 3: Green team
* Usability
    - they mentioned a website is part of it, and they mentioned that it will be broken (e.g. misspelling, broken links, incorrect information present)

### 4: White team
* Security documentation (pre-competition, AKA during our network access phase)
    - they provide templates for our documentations, not sure if we should use them or just use the UF 2019 report as a template

* Information sharing/incident reporting
    - Throughout the day, they may ask us to provide some sort of information or reports of incidents.

* C-suite panel brief (pre-competition)
    - this panel brief will involve our team recording a video for these managers. communication and explanation skills are important.
    - we will want to emphasize severity of breach, potentially even ask for resources/money...

### 5: Anomaly scores
* Real-world challenges/tasks
    - these could be CTF-type challenges such as forensics, crypto, etc. or even a new vuln introduced in our systems.
    - in general, these challenges are meant to pull attention away from the traditional role of protecting systems.


## USABILITY

* Our goal is to balance the usability of our systems for customers, employees, and ourselves WHILE maintaining security of the system.
    - BAD EXAMPLE: Implementing 10 passwords in a row within 30 seconds.
    - GOOD EXAMPLE: Implementing dual authentication (2 _different_ password mechanism)


## DOCUMENTATION

* The goal here is for us to be holistic blue teamers
    - This means we document what we are doing

* Part of understanding what we are building and defending is ensuring that others can quickly pick up where we left off
    - This way, we keep track of our hard work and others can benefit from it in the future.

* As mentioned before, this documentation needs to be written and submitted during the pre-competition phase (Oct 17th ~ November 3rd or so)
